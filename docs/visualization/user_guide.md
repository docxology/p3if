# P3IF Interactive Visualization Website: User Guide

This user guide provides step-by-step instructions for using the P3IF interactive visualization website with 3D cube visualization and domain selection.

## Getting Started

### Opening the Website

1. Locate the `p3if_full_website.html` file in the `output` directory.
2. Open the file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended).
3. The website will load with the default domain's data visualized in the 3D cube.

## Navigating the 3D Cube

### Basic Navigation

The 3D cube can be manipulated using your mouse:

1. **Rotate**: Click and drag anywhere in the visualization area to rotate the cube.
2. **Zoom**: Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
3. **Pan**: Hold the Shift key while clicking and dragging to move the cube around the screen.

### Understanding the Visualization

The 3D cube represents the three dimensions of the P3IF framework:

- **X-axis**: Properties
- **Y-axis**: Processes
- **Z-axis**: Perspectives

Each point within the cube represents a relationship between a property, process, and perspective from the selected domain. The points have the following characteristics:

- **Size**: Represents the strength of the relationship (larger = stronger)
- **Color**: Represents the confidence in the relationship (brighter = higher confidence)
- **Position**: Corresponds to the specific property (x), process (y), and perspective (z) in the relationship

## Selecting Different Domains

To view data from a different domain:

1. Locate the domain dropdown selector at the top of the page.
2. Click on the dropdown to see the list of available domains.
3. Select the domain you want to visualize from the list:
   - Artificial Intelligence
   - Healthcare
   - Blockchain
   - William Blake Poetry and Life
   - Climate Change
   - Immigration
   - Government Accessibility
   - National Security
   - Math Education
   - Power Grid
   - Science Research
   - Video Chat
   - Quantum Computing
   - ATM Withdrawal
   - Active Inference Grant Proposal
   - Pipette Use in Wet Lab
4. The visualization will automatically update to show the relationships for the selected domain.

## Reading the Information Panel

The information panel on the left side of the screen provides contextual information about the visualization:

1. **Title**: Shows the name of the visualization and the current domain.
2. **Legend**: Explains what the colors and sizes of points represent.
3. **Instructions**: Provides basic usage instructions for navigating the 3D cube.

## Tips for Effective Exploration

### Finding Patterns

To identify patterns and clusters in the data:

1. Rotate the cube to view it from different angles.
2. Look for clusters of points that might indicate areas of high relationship density.
3. Pay attention to variations in point size and color to identify strong relationships.

### Focusing on Specific Areas

To focus on a particular region of the cube:

1. Zoom in to the area of interest.
2. Use the pan function (Shift + drag) to center the area on your screen.
3. Slowly rotate the cube to examine relationships from different angles.

### Optimal Viewing

For the best viewing experience:

1. Use a larger screen if available.
2. Adjust your browser zoom level if needed (Ctrl/Cmd + '+' or '-').
3. View the website in full-screen mode (F11 in most browsers).

## Troubleshooting

### Visualization Not Loading

If the visualization doesn't load:

1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
2. Try refreshing the page.
3. Check your browser console for any error messages (F12 > Console tab).

### Performance Issues

If the visualization runs slowly:

1. Close other browser tabs and applications to free up system resources.
2. Try a different browser.
3. Reduce the browser window size to decrease rendering load.

### Domain Selector Not Working

If the domain selector doesn't respond:

1. Refresh the page and try again.
2. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors.
3. Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
