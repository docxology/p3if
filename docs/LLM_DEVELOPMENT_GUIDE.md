# P3IF Development Guide for LLMs and Autonomous Agents

This guide provides detailed instructions and best practices for LLMs (Large Language Models) and autonomous agents working on the P3IF (Properties, Processes, and Perspectives Inter-Framework) codebase.

## Understanding P3IF Architecture

P3IF is organized around three core dimensions:

1. **Properties**: Characteristics or attributes of entities within a domain
2. **Processes**: Actions, transformations, or workflows that occur within a domain
3. **Perspectives**: Viewpoints, contexts, or stakeholder positions that interpret a domain

All components in the codebase should align with this conceptual framework. When developing new features, consider how they relate to these dimensions.

## Code Generation Guidelines

### General Principles

- Follow single responsibility principle - each module, class, and function should have one clear purpose
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness
- Include proper type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use docstrings to explain code functionality, parameters, and return values

### Example Function Template

```python
def process_domain_relationships(
    domain_id: str, 
    strength_threshold: Optional[float] = 0.5,
    include_metadata: bool = False
) -> Dict[str, List[Relationship]]:
    """
    Process relationships within a specific domain.
    
    Args:
        domain_id: The identifier of the domain to process
        strength_threshold: Minimum relationship strength to include (0.0-1.0)
        include_metadata: Whether to include additional metadata in results
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping relationship types to lists of relationship objects
        
    Raises:
        DomainNotFoundError: If the specified domain doesn't exist
        InvalidThresholdError: If strength_threshold is outside range [0.0, 1.0]
        
    Example:
        >>> relationships = process_domain_relationships("healthcare", 0.7)
        >>> print(len(relationships["property_process"]))
        42
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### Error Handling Pattern

Always use the appropriate exception hierarchy:

```python
# Custom exception classes
class P3IFError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all P3IF errors."""
    pass

class DomainError(P3IFError):
    """Base exception for domain-related errors."""
    pass

class DomainNotFoundError(DomainError):
    """Raised when a domain is not found."""
    pass

# Error handling in functions
def get_domain(domain_id: str) -> Domain:
    """Get a domain by ID."""
    if not domain_exists(domain_id):
        raise DomainNotFoundError(f"Domain '{domain_id}' not found")
    # Implementation continues...
```

## Documentation Requirements

When adding new code, ensure that you provide:

1. **Function/Class Docstrings**: Follow Google-style format with descriptions, Args, Returns, Raises, and Examples
2. **Module Docstrings**: Describe the purpose and contents of each module
3. **Implementation Notes**: For complex algorithms, explain the approach and any non-obvious choices
4. **Comments**: Add inline comments for complex logic, but avoid commenting obvious code

## Testing Approach

When generating tests:

1. Create unit tests for each new function or class
2. Include both nominal (expected) cases and edge cases
3. Mock external dependencies to isolate the unit being tested
4. Use parameterized tests for multiple test cases
5. Follow the same directory structure in `tests/` as in the source code

Example test:

```python
import pytest
from p3if.data import domain_loader

def test_load_domain_valid():
    """Test loading a valid domain."""
    domain = domain_loader.load_domain("healthcare")
    assert domain.id == "healthcare"
    assert len(domain.properties) > 0
    assert len(domain.processes) > 0
    assert len(domain.perspectives) > 0

def test_load_domain_invalid():
    """Test loading an invalid domain raises the correct exception."""
    with pytest.raises(domain_loader.DomainNotFoundError):
        domain_loader.load_domain("nonexistent_domain")
```

## P3IF Specific Patterns

### Pattern Definition

When defining a Pattern:

```python
from p3if.core.models import Pattern, PatternType

# Define a property pattern
property_pattern = Pattern(
    name="Data Privacy",
    domain="Healthcare",
    type=PatternType.PROPERTY,
    description="The protection of personal health information from unauthorized access",
    metadata={"source": "HIPAA regulations", "importance": "high"}
)
```

### Relationship Modeling

When creating relationships between patterns:

```python
from p3if.core.models import Relationship

# Create a relationship between a property, process, and perspective
relationship = Relationship(
    property_id=property_id,
    process_id=process_id,
    perspective_id=perspective_id,
    strength=0.85,  # Strong relationship (0.0-1.0)
    confidence=0.92  # High confidence (0.0-1.0)
)
```

### Visualization Guidelines

When developing visualizations:

1. Separate data processing from rendering code
2. Make visualization parameters configurable
3. Include responsive design considerations
4. Provide user controls for exploring the data
5. Implement progressive loading for large datasets

## Code Review Checklist for LLM Developers

Before submitting code, verify that:

- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] All functions have appropriate type hints
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings are included
- [ ] Error cases are properly handled
- [ ] Tests are included for new functionality
- [ ] No hardcoded paths or values (use configuration)
- [ ] Performance considerations for large datasets
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect changes

## Best Practices for Autonomous Operation

For code that will run autonomously:

1. Implement comprehensive logging
2. Include self-diagnostic capabilities
3. Design graceful failure and recovery mechanisms
4. Use sensible defaults with configurable overrides
5. Validate all inputs, especially from external sources
6. Include timeouts and circuit breakers for external dependencies

## Contributing

When your code is ready, please ensure it follows our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting.

Remember that the goal of P3IF is to provide a flexible, interoperable approach to requirements engineering that bridges gaps between existing methodologies and fosters cross-domain collaboration.
